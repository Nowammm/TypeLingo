Introducing the ultimate solution for Duolingo learners who crave a seamless language learning experience! If you've ever found yourself frustrated by the tedious task of searching for words in the word bank, worry no more.

With just a click, this extension brings back the precious ability to type your responses in Duolingo's "Write this in English" exercise. Say farewell to the word bank's limitations and embrace the keyboard's full potential!

**The extension isn't functioning correctly?**

Try fully exiting Duolingo, then relaunch.

If that proves futile, wait until a bug fix is available.

# Building the source code
You may install the extension through the Chrome Web Store. However, you can build the source code yourself.

Keep in mind that once the extension receives an update, you will need to build it once more.

### Guide:

This guide will tell you how to build the source code on Google Chrome, although the steps are fairly identical for any Chromium-based browser.

* Download the source code and unzip the file (Save the folder somewhere safe because if the folder gets deleted, the extension gets deleted from the browser as well).
* Navigate to the "Manage extensions" menu (Or go to _chrome://extensions_).
* Enable developer mode on the top right.
* Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension's folder. Make sure that the root folder is the folder that contains all of the files.
* Relaunch Duolingo if needed.
